Enter an address, or a semicolon-delimited string of addresses, and geopositiondatabasegenerator returns a semicolon-delimited string of corresponding lattitude and longitude numbers.

How do you get a semicolon-delimited string of addresses, you might ask?  I dunno. Google the list of stuff you want then tweak it in Excel. That's how I do it. # geopositiondatabasegenerator
